 Changelog of Another PostgreSQL Diff Tool
------------------------------------------

-------------
Version 2.2.2
-------------

Fixes
* Added missing new line after ALTER VIEW ... ALTER COLUMN ... SET/DROP DEFAULT.
* Fixed parsing of quoted string values.
* Fixed detection of function body separator (did not work when there was
  another 'AS' specified on the same line after the 'AS' starting function
  body).
* If two dumps are completely same and there is more than one schema in the
  dumps, the output now does not contain 'SET search_path = ...'. In other
  words, if two dumps are completely same, no output is produced.
* Replaced 'ALTER VIEW name ALTER COLUMN ...' with 'ALTER TABLE view_name ALTER
  COLUMN ...' to make it compatible with PostgreSQL releases prior to 8.4.
* Fixed parsing of '' escapes.
Other
* Added support for localization of apgdiff.
* Added Czech localization.

-------------------------
2010-10-03: Version 2.2.1
-------------------------

New Features
* Commands like OWNER TO and ENABLE/DISABLE TRIGGER/RULE are now added to the
  diff output even for commands that are otherwise being parsed, like ALTER
  TABLE.
Fixes
* Fixed bug where default values were dropped from VIEW columns even if they
  were not modified.

-----------------------
2010-10-02: Version 2.2
-----------------------

New Features
* Statements that are not supported by apgdiff yet are now all ignored(till this
  release apgdiff had to be instructed to know what commands to ignore which was
  not good solution). This is the same behavior as in 1.* releases.
* Added command line switch <code>--output-ignored-statements</code> which can
  be used to output statements that apgdiff ignores in the dump files. This
  feature makes more clear what statements were ignored and developer has to
  handle them manually eventually.
